External csgo cheat for linux

##### If you dont know how to code or anything like that this project is not for you, I do not bypass vac in any way and now that this is public it will be signatured eventually and become detected.

This was a project mainly meant for learning how computers handle memory and the subsystem the OS uses to interact with it. Because that was the primary goal it is not a production cheat by any means, if you wish to use it I wont stop you but would not recommend it. All the keybinds are hardcoded in the input header and the offsets need to be updated. If you wish to learn how this stuff works than feel free to take a look at my code or join my discord and ask me and ill try to answer your questions.


##### I will not provide any support for getting this running besides this, I dont wanna deal with people asking how to get this running as this should be used as referance/learning resource, not as a standalone cheat.
1. update offsets and keybinds
2. generate makefiles with cmake
3. make the makefiles
4. run as root cause of my shitty input system

## Depedencies
`sudo apt install xdotool`
